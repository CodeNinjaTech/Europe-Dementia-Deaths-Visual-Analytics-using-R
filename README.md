Assignment 1 for the Analytics Practicum II Course of AUEB's MSc in Business Analytics

**Objective:**
The project aims to analyze deaths from dementia in European countries between 2011 and 2020, focusing on gender-based trends. The primary goal is to investigate whether there is an increasing trend in dementia-related deaths in Greece compared to the rest of Europe.

**Data Sources:**
- The provided dataset includes information on dementia-related deaths in European countries by gender for the years 2011-2020.
- Additional complementary and detailed data can be sourced from the [Eurostat database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/HLTH_CD_ARO__custom_5936571/default/table?lang=en).

**Deliverables:**
1. **Presentation**: A PowerPoint or PDF presentation containing a minimum of 10 static visualizations created using R. The presentation should comprehensively explore the data and present findings on whether there is a distinct trend in dementia-related deaths in Greece compared to other European countries. The presentation should be self-contained for delivery to an audience with varying levels of knowledge on the topic.

2. **R Code**: The R code used to generate the visualizations presented in the report.

**Optional:**
- Interactive plots in Shiny are welcome but not mandatory for this project.

**Grading Criteria:**
- Correctness of analysis
- Variety and originality of visualizations
- Execution and presentation quality
- Creativity in data exploration and interpretation
